# Ecological Data Analysis with R

## Overview

This repository contains data generated by my Master's Dissertation Project from the course Ecology Evolution and Biodiversity at the University of Edinburgh (2024) and accompanying R scripts for data analysis. The goal of this project is to assess diatom mortality over extended dark durations and subsequent growth rate when re-inoculated into the light.
